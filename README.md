# WDWWaits
By using the information given by [EasyWDW](https://www.easywdw.com/waits), I can create a data set of rides and wait times every 15 minutes throughout the day. Using this data set I can do some basic analytics.

The script uses beautifulsoup4 to parse the webpage for the ride, location, and wait time data.
