This is a script that records wait time data for attractions in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It uses MouseTools, my python hook into Disney's API.

The goal is to create a large data set to perform future analysis on. The data set currently holds the ride, location of the ride, the park it's in, and the wait times at a given time.
